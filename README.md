# Regression <br>
This Python (Jupyter NB 6) project aims to showcase linear and logistic regression performed on a single variable.

## Features: <br>
- **A generator**: capable of generating synthetic data. Synthesizes data distributed normally around a specified line. Variance can be controlled. <br>
- **Learning rates**: You can set learning rate differently for slope and bias. <br>
- **Comparing fit with Generator line**: A plot is shown at the end comparing fit line with generator line, as well as the cost functions of both.

## To-do: <br>
- Logistic regression part
